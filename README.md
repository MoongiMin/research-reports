#### ðŸ“„ Abstract
This study investigates sound-based monitoring for additive manufacturing machines using a custom sound sensor and a CNN model. Audio data from a Renishaw AM-400 was analyzed with features such as RMS, spectral centroid, and FFT energy.  
The CNN distinguishes Printing vs. Off states, showing that sound can be a reliable, low-cost method for smart manufacturing monitoring.
