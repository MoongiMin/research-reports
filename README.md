#### ðŸ“„ Abstract
This study investigates sound-based monitoring for additive manufacturing machines using a custom sound sensor and a CNN model. Audio data from a Renishaw AM-400 was analyzed with features such as RMS, spectral centroid, and FFT energy.  
The CNN distinguishes Printing vs. Off states, showing that sound can be a reliable, low-cost method for smart manufacturing monitoring.  
However, since the current model only handles two highly distinguishable states (On vs. Off), there may be a **generalization issue** when expanding to multiple intermediate operating states.  
The next step will involve training the model on more diverse machine conditions to evaluate its robustness and improve generalization across subtle state variations.
